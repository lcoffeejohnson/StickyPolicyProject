# StickyPolicyProject

This project models a User with a policy regarding the use of personal data and a ServiceProvider who handles that data.

To run:

1. Open two separate terminal windows (the Client and Server are both running on localhost)
2. Run the ServiceProvider first
3. Next, run the User
